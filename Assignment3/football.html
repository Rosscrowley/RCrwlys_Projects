<h2>History of the Sport</h2>
</p>
<p>
<div class="textleft">
Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. According to FIFA, the Chinese competitive game 
cuju is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence. Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent
 was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to there were many similarities to rugby.
 The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in 
 the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century. These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation 
 of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863.

<h2>The Top 5 leagues</h2>
</p>
<p>
<div class="textleft">
Comparing the top five European football leagues is an occuring discussion point in the sport of football. Itâ€™s a timeless topic,
 an area that can provoke debate and frustration. In many ways it is subjective, and those who favour one league over another 
 obviously bring their own chunk of bias to the table.
 The top 5 leagues include:

<li>Premier League</li>
<li>Bundesliga</li>
<li>La Liga</li>

Many argue that due to the other four leagues having being dominated by single teams over many years they are easier to play in then the Premier League
who many boast to be the hardest and most physical to play in and the fact that many players that come from other leagues into the Premier League struggle to
find their form just adds more fuel to that arguement.
