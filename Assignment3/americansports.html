 of its predecessor organization, the National Hockey Association (NHA), which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew, Ontario. At its inception, the NHL had four teamsâ€”all 
 in Canada, thus the adjective "National" in the league's name. The league expanded to the United States in 1924, when the Boston Bruins joined, and has since consisted 
 of American and Canadian teams. The NHL draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from approximately 20 countries. 
 Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the league, with an increasing percentage of American and European players in recent seasons.
